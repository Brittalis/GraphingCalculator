Follow the below instructions to setup everything for the class project. If you don't follow these guidelines and end up losing some of your work, that's on you and you'll have to redo it. Sorry :(

#####Getting Started

1. [Download Git.](https://git-scm.com/downloads) Git allows programmers to seamlessly share their project classes with the rest of their team, ensuring that no progress is lost and everyone can receive and up-to-date copy whenever they want.
2. [Setup Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) This page is really helpful when it comes to using and setting up Git for the first time. During the first meeting Jake and Owen will be making sure everyone has succesfully set up Git.
